## Work Completed
- Initialized Memory Bank for MCP server project.
- Created productContext.md with project vision, goals, and constraints.
- Created activeContext.md with current session context and goals.
- Created decisionLog.md to track key architectural and technical decisions.
- Documented key architectural patterns in systemPatterns.md.
- Refactored src/cm360.ts to use named exports for handler functions.
- Updated all test files to use named exports for handler functions.
- Updated the tools test to match the current implementation (five tools).
- Corrected jest.mock usage in index.test.ts to mock named exports.
- Verified that all tests pass after these updates (6/6 suites, 25/25 tests).
- **Added support for the creativeGroups.list API method following established design patterns.**
- **Integrated creativeGroups.list into the test suite, updating the tools test and documenting the process in systemPatterns.md for future reference.**
- **Implemented a file-based debug logging system for all major MCP tool handlers. All invocation and debug information is now written to mcp-debug.log in the project root, overwritten on each server start for session-based debugging.**

## Next Steps
- Maintain alignment between code and test suite as new features or refactors are introduced.
- Continue to enforce read-only access and auditability for all CM360 API operations.
- Ensure that all new tools and handlers are documented and tested.
- **For future API method support, follow the documented pattern in systemPatterns.md to ensure consistency and test coverage.**
- **Review mcp-debug.log after tool invocations for debugging and troubleshooting, especially when console output is not visible.**

## Ongoing Memory Bank Update Process

1. **Trigger Points for Updates**
   - After any significant code change, architectural decision, or new integration.
   - When new patterns, constraints, or requirements are identified.
   - At the end of each development session.

2. **Update Procedure**
   - Summarize recent changes in activeContext.md under "Recent Changes."
   - Log key decisions and rationale in decisionLog.md.
   - Record completed work and next steps in progress.md.
   - Add or update patterns in systemPatterns.md as needed.
   - Revise productContext.md if project vision, goals, or constraints change.

3. **Review and Verification**
   - Periodically review all Memory Bank files for accuracy and completeness.
   - Ensure documentation reflects the current state of the codebase and architecture.

4. **Collaboration**
   - Encourage all contributors to follow the update process.
   - Use the Memory Bank as the single source of truth for project context and decisions.

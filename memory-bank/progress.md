# Campaign Manager 360 MCP Server - Progress

## Work Done

### 2025-03-21
- Initialized Memory Bank
- Created core documentation files:
  - productContext.md: Project overview, goals, and technical details
  - activeContext.md: Current session context and goals
  - progress.md: This file - tracking work and next steps
  - decisionLog.md: Key decisions and rationale
- Analyzed API architecture pattern:
  - Examined the layered architecture (routes, controllers, services)
  - Documented the dependency injection pattern
  - Reviewed request validation and error handling approaches
  - Updated systemPatterns.md with detailed architecture documentation
  - Added API architecture decision to decisionLog.md
- Enforced API architecture pattern:
  - Updated systemPatterns.md to clearly mark mandatory patterns
  - Added detailed guidelines for implementing new API endpoints
  - Added a new decision log entry about strict enforcement
  - Emphasized the importance of following the established pattern
  - Provided clear examples and templates for each layer
- Created developer resources for API architecture:
  - Added README.md in src/api directory with architecture overview
  - Created TEMPLATES.md with template code for each layer
  - Added usage instructions for creating new API endpoints
  - Updated productContext.md with development guidelines
  - Created codeReviewChecklist.md for verifying compliance with the pattern
  - Created apiDevelopmentGuide.md with step-by-step process and best practices

## Next Steps



### API Architecture Enforcement
- [x] Create a code review checklist for verifying compliance with the API architecture pattern
- [x] Create comprehensive API development guide with best practices
- [ ] Develop automated linting rules to enforce architectural patterns
- [ ] Consider implementing a more robust dependency injection container
- [ ] Evaluate performance implications of the current architecture
- [ ] Implement consistent response formatting across all endpoints

### Core Infrastructure
- [ ] Review and validate environment configuration
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling throughout the application
- [ ] Implement comprehensive logging strategy

### MCP Server Implementation
- [x] Review current MCP resource implementations
- [x] Review current MCP tool implementations
- [x] Refactor MCP server for better modularity and maintainability
- [x] Implement dependency injection pattern in MCP components
- [ ] Identify opportunities for additional resources and tools
- [ ] Implement error handling and validation for all MCP operations
- [ ] Ensure proper integration between MCP server and REST API layers

### Testing
- [ ] Ensure comprehensive test coverage for all components
- [ ] Create end-to-end tests for critical user flows
- [ ] Create test fixtures and mocks for CM360 API responses
- [ ] Add unit tests for each layer (routes, controllers, services)

### Documentation
- [ ] Document all API endpoints
- [ ] Create usage examples for common scenarios
- [ ] Document deployment process
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Add code examples for extending the API with new endpoints

### Performance and Security
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- [ ] Review and enhance authentication mechanisms
- [ ] Implement caching strategy for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Conduct security review of the application
- [ ] Add input sanitization to prevent injection attacks

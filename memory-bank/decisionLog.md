## [2025-04-11] - Memory Bank Initialization

**Context:**  
Project kickoff for MCP server interfacing with CM360 API v4. No prior documentation or memory-bank existed.

**Decision:**  
Establish a Memory Bank system with four core documentation files: productContext.md, activeContext.md, progress.md, and decisionLog.md.

**Rationale:**  
To ensure a clean, auditable, and well-documented architecture that supports future development and decision tracking.

**Implementation:**  
Created the memory-bank/ directory and initialized all core files with project-specific context and structure.

## [2025-04-11] - Refactor and Test Suite Synchronization

**Context:**  
The codebase was refactored to use named exports for all handler functions in src/cm360.ts. The test suite was out of sync with these changes.

**Decision:**  
Update all test files to import and use handler functions as named exports. Update the tools test to match the current implementation (five tools). Correct jest.mock usage in index.test.ts to mock named exports.

**Rationale:**  
To ensure the test suite accurately reflects the codebase, maintains full coverage, and supports future extensibility.

**Implementation:**  
- Updated all test files to use named exports for handler functions.
- Updated the tools test to expect all five tools.
- Corrected jest.mock usage in index.test.ts.
- Verified that all tests pass after these updates (6/6 suites, 25/25 tests).

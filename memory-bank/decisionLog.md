## [2025-04-11] - Memory Bank Initialization

**Context:**  
Project kickoff for MCP server interfacing with CM360 API v4. No prior documentation or memory-bank existed.

**Decision:**  
Establish a Memory Bank system with four core documentation files: productContext.md, activeContext.md, progress.md, and decisionLog.md.

**Rationale:**  
To ensure a clean, auditable, and well-documented architecture that supports future development and decision tracking.

**Implementation:**  
Created the memory-bank/ directory and initialized all core files with project-specific context and structure.

## [2025-04-11] - Refactor and Test Suite Synchronization

**Context:**  
The codebase was refactored to use named exports for all handler functions in src/cm360.ts. The test suite was out of sync with these changes.

**Decision:**  
Update all test files to import and use handler functions as named exports. Update the tools test to match the current implementation (five tools). Correct jest.mock usage in index.test.ts to mock named exports.

**Rationale:**  
To ensure the test suite accurately reflects the codebase, maintains full coverage, and supports future extensibility.

**Implementation:**  
- Updated all test files to use named exports for handler functions.
- Updated the tools test to expect all five tools.
- Corrected jest.mock usage in index.test.ts.
- Verified that all tests pass after these updates (6/6 suites, 25/25 tests).

## [2025-04-12] - Modularization of CM360 API Handlers

**Context:**  
As the number of CM360 API methods and handler functions grew, maintaining all logic in a single file (src/cm360.ts) became unwieldy and error-prone. There was a need for improved maintainability, clarity, and extensibility.

**Decision:**  
Refactor the CM360 API integration to use a modular handler structure:
- Each API domain (advertisers, campaigns, creatives, eventTags, placements, etc.) is implemented as a separate module in the `src/cm360/` directory.
- Handler functions are exported from their respective files and re-exported via `src/cm360/index.ts`.
- The legacy src/cm360.ts file now serves as an entry point and compatibility layer, delegating to the modularized handlers.

**Rationale:**  
- Improves separation of concerns and code organization.
- Makes it easier to add, test, and maintain individual API domains.
- Supports future extensibility and onboarding of new developers.

**Implementation:**  
- Moved all handler functions to their respective domain files under `src/cm360/`.
- Updated `src/cm360/index.ts` to re-export all handlers.
- Updated documentation and Memory Bank files to reflect the new architecture.
- Removed references to the old monolithic handler pattern.

## [2025-04-12] - File-Based Debug Logging System

**Context:**  
Debugging tool invocations was difficult when the MCP server was managed by a chat application and console output was not visible.

**Decision:**  
Implement a file-based debug logging system for all major MCP tool handlers. All invocation and debug information is now written to `mcp-debug.log` in the project root, and the log file is overwritten on each server start.

**Rationale:**  
- Ensures that invocation and debug information is always accessible, regardless of how the MCP server is managed.
- Supports session-based debugging and troubleshooting.

**Implementation:**  
- Added a logging utility to `src/cm360/utils.ts` that writes to `mcp-debug.log`.
- Updated all major tool handlers to log invocation, arguments, and results to the file.
- Documented the logging system in README.md and Memory Bank files.

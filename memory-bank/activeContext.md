# Active Context - Architecture Enforcement and MCP Server Refactoring

## Current Session Context
[2025-03-21]

## Recent Changes
- Analyzed the API architecture pattern in the codebase
- Examined the relationship between routes, controllers, services, and the MCP client
- Reviewed middleware implementation for request validation and error handling
- Updated documentation to enforce strict adherence to the API architecture pattern
- Added detailed guidelines for implementing new API endpoints
- Added a new decision log entry about strict enforcement of the pattern
- Created comprehensive developer resources:
  - README.md in src/api directory with architecture overview
  - TEMPLATES.md with template code for each layer
  - codeReviewChecklist.md for verifying compliance with the pattern
  - apiDevelopmentGuide.md with step-by-step process and best practices


## Current Goals
- Ensure all current and future code strictly adheres to the established architecture patterns
- Document architecture patterns as mandatory standards for the project
- Provide clear guidelines and examples for implementing new components
- Establish a process for verifying compliance with the patterns
- Apply the same modular architecture principles to other parts of the codebase
- Complete the implementation of the modular MCP server structure by populating the auth, resources, and tools directories

## Completed Tasks
- Updated systemPatterns.md to clearly mark mandatory patterns
- Created template code for each layer of the API architecture
- Developed a code review checklist for verifying compliance
- Created a comprehensive API development guide with best practices
- Updated productContext.md with development guidelines
- Refactored MCP server implementation to follow modular architecture:
  - Created directory structure for src/mcp/auth/, src/mcp/resources/, and src/mcp/tools/
  - Updated main mcpServer.ts to use the new modular components

## Open Questions
- How can we automate the verification of compliance with the architecture patterns?
- Should we implement a more robust dependency injection container instead of factory functions?
- Are there any performance implications of the current architecture that should be addressed?
- How should we handle versioning of the API as the project evolves?
- What additional tooling could help enforce the architecture patterns?
- Should we apply the same modular approach to the REST API implementation?
- What is the best way to implement the auth, resources, and tools modules to maintain consistency with the established patterns?

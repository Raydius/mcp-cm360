## Project Vision
This project is an MCP server that interfaces with the CM360 API v4, designed for advanced marketers who leverage MCP servers to inquire about their Campaign Manager 360 account.

## Main Goals
- Provide a clean and auditable codebase.
- Restrict all functionality to read-only operations using the CM360 v4 API.
- Ensure all code is easily maintainable and extensible.
- Facilitate advanced, programmatic access to CM360 data for marketing professionals.

## Key Constraints
- Only read-only functions from the CM360 v4 API are permitted.
- All API usage must comply with the documentation: https://developers.google.com/doubleclick-advertisers/rest/v4/
